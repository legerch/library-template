This library can be use as an _embedded library_ in a subdirectory of your project (like a _git submodule_ for example) :
1. In the **root** CMakeLists, add instructions :
```cmake
add_subdirectory(MyLibrary) # Or if library is put in a folder "dependencies" : add_subdirectory(dependencies/MyLibrary)
```

2. In the **application/library** CMakeLists, add instructions :
```cmake
# Link needed libraries
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE mylibrary)
```

# 4. Documentation

All methods has been documented with [Doxygen][doxygen-official] utility, documentation can be generated by using:
```shell
# Run documentation generation
doxygen ./Doxyfile

# Under Windows OS, maybe doxygen is not added to the $PATH
"C:\Program Files\doxygen\bin\doxygen.exe" ./Doxyfile
```
> **Note:** You can also load the _Doxyfile_ into _Doxywizard_ (Doxygen GUI) and run generation.
